# wp-lazysizes
Brings lazySizes.js to wordpress

##Contributing and looking for maintainers
Although this wordpress plugin is pretty solid and can be used in production, it could be heavily improved. I'm a pure JS developer and I'm searching for a PHP-/wordpress developer, who wants to take over this project or at least want to become the lead developer/maintainer.
